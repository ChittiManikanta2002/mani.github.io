## Projects

### Line Follower Robot
- Designed a line-following robot for autonomous navigation, integrating sensors and control algorithms for precise path tracking.
  - **Tools & Technologies**: Arduino
  - Designed and developed a line-following robot with sensor fusion and PID control for precise navigation. Collaborated in a cross-functional team to integrate hardware seamlessly and validate performance.

### Simple Water Level Indicator
- Developed a simple water level indicator using sensors and alert mechanisms to prevent overflow and dry-running in containers.
  - **Tools & Technologies**: Arduino
  - A simple water level indicator is a device that signals when the water level in a container reaches a certain point. It typically consists of a sensor, such as a float switch or probes, and an alert mechanism like a light or buzzer. As the water level rises or falls, the sensor activates or deactivates the alert. It's commonly used in tanks, wells, and reservoirs for efficient water management.

### Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning
- Developed advanced rainfall prediction models to optimize accuracy for applications in agriculture and disaster management.
  - **Tools & Technologies**: Jupyter Notebook
  - Implemented a rainfall prediction system using LSTM, ANN, and RNN algorithms, enhancing accuracy in weather forecasting. Collaborated with peers to preprocess data, train models, and deploy the system effectively.
